# Foundry Simple Storage

Foundry.toml - gives us configuration parameters while working with foundry.

## Compiling in Foundry
To compile a solidity file in foundry:
```
forge compile
```
This compiles the file and gives the output under a new directory named as ```out```.

## Deploying to a local blockchain
Foundry comes built-in with a virtual environment.

    anvil

This gives us an output for test accounts, their balances and their private keys.
